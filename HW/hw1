Homework 1
This assignment gives you some practice with NetLogo and agents.
Some general requirements:
·         The names and signatures (Java’s term that corresponds to C++ prototypes) need to follow what is required below. I have written test cases that assume these names and signatures. They will not pass if you are sloppy with spelling, case, typos.
·         Follow traditional school assignment code style, even though some aspects may not be completely supported by NetLogo:
·         One line comments for each procedure/reporter
·         Use all-uppercase for constants even though there is nothing like const or final
·         Use meaningful names for all variables, avoiding single-letter identifier names
Requirements:
·         Create a NetLogo file to model an agent that does ocean fishing from a boat (like you might find at Half Moon Bay). Here are some things to include in your model
o    The goal is to catch the most fish
o    The “world” is a 5 by 5 grid with (0, 0) at the bottom left corner
§  Each patch starts with a random number of fish
§  For this and other features that eventually require randomness, you may find it easier to start with fixed values to make testing easier
§  neither the species nor weight of the fish are distinguished
§  The number of fish does not regenerate (unlike the wolf-sheep example)
§  The fish do not move
§  Give the patches a color that lets the user see where the boat is
o    (0, 0) is considered to be the “port”
o    The boat:
§  starts at the port
§  should keep track of how many fish it has caught on each square
§  can move 1 square during each tick, either laterally or vertically (diagonal movement is not supported)
§  has a limit of 20 ticks per trip, at the end of which it must be back at the port,
§  does not require maintenance
§  can spend a tick fishing the current square instead of moving, which will gain the boat 10 fish or all the fish left if there are fewer than 10 fish
§  should not try to fish again in a square where it did not catch any fish on a previous attempt
§  you can choose any icon to represent the boat, but it should be visible against the “sea”
o    The total number of fish caught should be reported at the end
o    For CS 6810 students, you need to do the above, plus:
§  You have a crude “fish-finder” sensor. For each patch, it will give a reading of 0-100
§  Each time you run the program, the readings will be initialized randomly, but the readings do not change during the run
§  The port reading is always 0
§  The number of fish is a random value from 0 to this reading
§  The boat can collect the reading of a square while moving
§  The boat does not have the reading information initially, but should store that information as it operates
Grading: 80% is for correctness.
10% is for comments for the procedures/reporters and any important variables.
10% is for naming within the submitted code, including naming constants and meaningful names for variables, functions.
