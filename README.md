Intro to Artificial Intelligence course I took at CSU East Bay

Considering this class was a survey course, the assignments were all over the place. Not my greatest work, but often times, the professor said he didn't care if the program worked efficiently, just that it worked (lol). So...some of the assignments were copy and pasters from examples (his suggestion and his referrals FYI).

I am sure to become more efficient once I take the Machine Learning and Computer Vision courses.

NetLogo, Gecode, and OpenCV were what was used in the class.
